# first_flutter_app

This is my first Flutter app from the _Google Developer Groups: Flutter Forward_ event at Google in Ann Arbor. This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Below is a list of all the amazing things I learned from this GDG event and the Codelab:
- The basics of how Flutter works
- Creating layouts in Flutter
- Connecting user interactions (like button presses) to app behavior
- Keeping your Flutter code organized
- Making your app responsive
- Achieving a consistent look & feel of your app

A few resources I used:
- [Lab: Your first Flutter app](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#0)
- [Flutter online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/)
